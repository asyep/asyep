### 👤 About Me

I am an undergraduate **Software Engineering student at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia** with a strong interest in **Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI**.  

With a foundation in software engineering, I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, logic, and systems** — transforming raw data into meaningful insights while also understanding how software is built, structured, and scaled.

I am currently preparing myself for **internship opportunities** where I can contribute, learn, and grow in data-driven and technology-oriented environments.
